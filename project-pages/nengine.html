          I have started this project to learn internals of game engine.
          The main goal is to have a firm understanding on how core engine systems work under the hood.
        </div>
        <div class="body-text">I have got a good grasp of how engine systems work by creating most of the systems
          myself. Sure most of what I have implemented is not robust and probably has significant performance issues,
          but nevertheless I have got an understanding of how those various engine systems work. I have implemented
          simple ECS, input processing, camera movement, simple math library and math library wrapper for
          DirectXMath, added support for gLTF 2.0 models, there is a simple collision detection, primitive audio output
          with XAudio2 and unfinished PBR. You can find this implementation on <a
            href="https://github.com/vocasle/NEngine/tree/dx11" target="_blank">dx11</a> branch.</div>

          Currently the active branch is <a href="https://github.com/vocasle/NEngine/tree/vulkan"
            target="_blank">vulkan</a> branch. I would like to move from platform specific GAPI like DirectX 11 to
          platform independent GAPI like Vulkan. To support multiple platforms I have decided to use platform
          independent SDL2 library that will help to initalize window and process user input.

              - To add an image to the this area, copy one of the above, paste it below this comment, and change the following:
                  - IMAGE_NAME: the name of the image file in assets/images
                  - IMAGE_CAPTION: to the caption of the image
