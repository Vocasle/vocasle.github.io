        <div class="body-text">My journey as developer begun from web development. I have started to learn how to code with <a
            href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-developer-course-2" target="_blank">"The Complete Web
            Developer Course 2.0"</a> online course on Udemy. After that I have learned that JavaScript is a compiled
          language by reading @getify's <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS">"You Dont'
            Know JS"</a>. During that time I have landed my first job as web developer. After some time I was assigned
          to work on hybrid mobile apps. I have discovered Apache Cordova, than I have touched NativeScript and finally
          I have started to develop native mobile applications for both Android and iOS platforms. Here I yet again
          hardened my knowledge of Model View Controller design pattern. I have enjoyed working with statically typed
          languages and I have started to study C++. I have read 2/3 of "Programming: Principles and Practice using C++
          (2nd edition)" by Bjarne Stroustrup. I think that this is a good book to begin your journey as a self taught
          developer. I have worked through <a target="_blank"
            href="https://github.com/vocasle/principles_and_practice_using_cpp">some exercises</a> as well. At that time
          I was trying to use CMake as a build system. I have spent dozen of time trying to link dependencies with
          CMake. And I am happy that I did not drop trying to do so. Right now I use CMake mostly all the time except
          when I work on Windows. After I have spent about a year of learning C++ after my day job I have landed a job
          in gamedev. I was very happy because I was tired of web development and I wanted to work on something serious.
        </div>
        <div class="body-text">During my work as gamedeveloper I was mostly working with Unreal Engine 4 and I have had
          a chance to work with Unreal Engine 3.5 codebase. Aside from my work I have started to learn OpenGL by
          following <a href="https://learnopengl.com" target="_blank">learnopengl.com</a>. I have completed <a
            href="https://github.com/vocasle/learn_open_gl" target="_blank">excercises up to model loading</a> and I was
          kind of happy when I have loaded Sponza model. I have also maid a <a
            href="https://github.com/vocasle/gl_snake" target="_blank">silly snake game</a>. It is silly yeas, but I
          have enjoyed the process of making a game without a game engine. After that I have started to explore <a
            href="https://github.com/vocasle/dx11/tree/sponza-nofog-nobloom" target="_blank">DirectX 11</a>. I have
          covered a bunch of rendering techniques such as Phong shading, PCF shadows, dynamic environment reflections
          via cubemap, fog post process effect, bloom post process effect, particle systems. At that time I have
          switched my position to rendering software engineer. I have had a chance to fix some rendering issues in
          Unreal 4 based project after we have upgraded engine from 4.19 to 4.27. Also I was working on porting DirectX
          9 renderer to DirectX 11. It was a lot of fun.</div>
        <div class="body-text">Aside from my work I was working on my own game engine - <a
            href="https://github.com/vocasle/NEngine/tree/dx11" target="_blank">NEngine</a>. I have started with
          facilities that I have invented during the time I was learning DirectX 11. Some of those facilities were
          rewritten from scratch. I have rewrote my math library for few times for sure. I did not use any third party
          libraries for window management and user input and because of that I know a little bit of WIN32 API. The
          render was pretty basic. All I had is phong shading and non-working PBR. But I was mostly focused on other
          engine components such as: sound, entity management system, user input, Wavefront *.obj model parser.
          Currently I have switched my priorities but I will definitely switch back to NEngine in the near future. Right
          now I work on DirectX 12 renderer. I would like to implement PBR with IBL, skinning, SSAO, SSLR, MSAA. Try
          deffered lighting approach and see what are the cons and pros of this approach.</div>
